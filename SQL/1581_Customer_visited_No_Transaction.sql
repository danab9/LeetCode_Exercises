transaction_id is column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id.
 

Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

Return the result table sorted in any order.

/*
My solution: 
I use a LEFT JOIN to join the Visits table with the Transactions table on the visit_id column.
Then, I filter the result to only include rows where the transaction_id is NULL, which means that the user visited without making any transactions.
Finally, I group the result by customer_id and count the number of visits without transactions for each user.

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
    ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
